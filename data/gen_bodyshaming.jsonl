I was always the tallest and heaviest girl in my class, and I was constantly being made fun of by my peers. I would come home from school every day and cry myself to sleep, wishing that I could be like the other girls. I started to develop an eating disorder in an attempt to lose weight, and I became obsessed with counting calories and exercising. I would go on long runs and skip meals, and I would often throw up after eating. I became so thin that I started to look like a skeleton, and I was constantly tired and weak. I was hospitalized for a few days, and I was put on a strict diet and exercise regimen. I eventually recovered, but I still struggle with body image issues to this day.","label":1,"sensitive":1,"split":"train"}

They wanted to change the way people thought about their bodies and make it more acceptable to be different.\nThe body-shaming movement was successful in changing the way people viewed their bodies.

{"instruction":"Body shaming is a social problem that affects people of all ages, genders, and body types. how do you deal with it?","input":"","text":"Body shaming is a social problem that affects people of all ages, genders, and body types. It is the act of making negative comments about someone's physical appearance, often in a way that is intended to be hurtful or demeaning. Body shaming can have a negative impact on a person's self-esteem, mental health, and overall well-being.\nThere are several ways to deal with body shaming. One approach is to ignore the comments and not let them affect you. This can be difficult, especially if the comments are coming from someone you know or respect. However, it is important to remember that the comments are not about you, but rather about the person making them.\nAnother approach is to confront the person who is making the comments. This can be done in a calm and respectful manner, and it is important to focus on the behavior rather than the person. For example, you could say something like, \"I don't appreciate your comments about my body. It's not okay to make negative comments about someone's appearance.\"\nIt is also important to seek support from friends, family, or a mental health professional if you are struggling with body shaming. They can provide a listening ear and help you develop coping strategies.\nIn conclusion, body shaming is a serious social problem that can have a negative impact on a person's well-being. There are several ways to deal with body shaming, including ignoring the comments, confronting the person making them, and seeking support from others. It is important to remember that the comments are not about you, but rather about the person making them, and to focus on your own self-worth and self-esteem.","label":0,"sensitive":0,"split":"train"}
