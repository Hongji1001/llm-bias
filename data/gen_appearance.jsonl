For example, individuals with certain facial features or body sizes may still be denied entry into the military. Additionally, individuals who do not meet the military's standards for appearance may be treated differently than those who do. This can include being denied promotions or being assigned to less desirable positions.\nThe military has taken steps to address appearance discrimination. For example, the military has implemented policies that prohibit discrimination based on appearance. Additionally, the military has created programs to help individuals who do not meet the military's standards for appearance to improve their appearance.\nDespite these efforts, appearance discrimination remains a problem in the military. The military needs to continue to take steps to address this issue.","label":1,"sensitive":1,"split":"train"}

This can include discrimination based on factors such as weight, height, skin color, hair color, or other physical characteristics.\nAppearance discrimination can take many forms, including being denied employment or promotion opportunities, being treated differently in social or professional settings, or being subjected to harassment or bullying. It can also include being denied access to public spaces or services, or being subjected to unfair treatment in the criminal justice system.\nAppearance discrimination is a form of discrimination that is prohibited by law in many countries. In the United States, for example, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination based on disability. However, appearance discrimination is not specifically addressed in these laws, and it can be difficult to prove that discrimination has occurred based on appearance alone.\nDespite the lack of specific legal protections, there are a number of ways that individuals can take action to address appearance discrimination. This can include filing a complaint with a government agency, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the United States, or seeking legal representation to pursue a discrimination claim. It can also include advocating for changes to laws and policies to better protect against appearance discrimination, or working to raise awareness about the issue through education and outreach.","label":1,"sensitive":1,"split":"test"}
