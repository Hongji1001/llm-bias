        "6182":"Tyrone Power, in \"Witness for the Prosecution,\" should have been nominated for best actor instead of Brando here.<br \/><br \/>The film, dealing with racism, dealt with the U.S. government's attempt to avoid marriages between U.S. soldiers and Japanese women.<br \/><br \/>Brando was stone-faced throughout the movie.",
        "6187":"The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention.",

        "6805":"The difference with this film is, first the director lets us 'see' inside the head of some of the characters and second, some scenes are repeated as means to refresh the viewer's memory as the story flip-flops between different time periods.<br \/><br \/>The basic \u0096 the core, so to speak \u0096 story concerns a young woman, Irene (Tautou) who is told, by a fellow commuter on a train, that she will meet her true love on that day.",

        "6890":"Its rather funny that director Rob Schmidt who only has the not bad Wrong Turn to his credit and writer John Esposito whose only scripting chores to date have included Tale Of The Mummy and Graveyard Shift should be the ones to give us the best written and most thought provoking episode of the season.",
        "6908":"The kid brother is a lawyer, and the triad gang is becoming increasingly in need of one, as the movie progresses.",
        "6909":"It all leads up to vengeance and redemption, qualities that Miike and his writer are trying to emulate from Shakespeare (hence the Macbeth bit with Wang washing his bloody hangs over and over after some gay sex saying \"it won't come off\").<br \/><br \/>If it doesn't add up to the same emotional level of impact that a great Shakespeare play would have, it's par for the course of a film like this.",
        "6911":"Miike and his writer don't have enough here to make the film a full-on dark comedy like Ichi or, of course, Visitor Q, but there's enough to bring some appropriate levity to the darker aspects to the story and characters.<br \/><br \/>As the first entry of the \"Black Society\" trilogy, as it's called, I was quite impressed, and it's a fine quasi-calling card from one of the craziest new artists in contemporary cinema.",
        "6917":"The set designer uses a sense of humor and also a great deal of insight when matching each cast member with their background.<br \/><br \/>Fans will be excited to hear personal testimony regarding Ed Wood controversies, and new comers will be amazed that this man was real.",
        "6934":"Like punctuation for each plot advance, director Fred Schepisi cuts away from restaurant to tennis court to dinner party to saloon to office, where the public tries Lindy and gets carried away into their own passionate projections.<br \/><br \/>This Golan-Globus docudrama is not particularly memorable.",
        "6935":"In August 1980 the disappearance of baby Azaria Chamberlain and the pursuant trial of her parents Lindy and Michael for the alleged murder of the child caused an uproar across what was then a very angry nation.",
        "6937":"That in fact a dingo did take baby Azaria on that fateful night at Ayers Rock.<br \/><br \/>Schepisi has brilliantly captured the mood of a blood thirsty nation, hell bent on 'the truth' being brought to light.",
        "6944":"This assumption came from the fact that aside from Streep's Best Actress nomination, the movie received little attention from major awards groups.<br \/><br \/>Little did I anticipate that A CRY IN THE DARK would be such a riveting drama, well-constructed on every level.",
        "6945":"Fred Schepisi (the director) selects random moments to capture of a family on vacation that give a looming sense of the oncoming tragedy, while also showing the attentive bliss with which Lindy (Streep) and Michael (Sam Neill) Chamberlain care for their children.<br \/><br \/>While the famous line \"A Dingo Took My Baby!\"",
        "6948":"And Neill, an actor who has never impressed me beyond being charismatic and appealing in JURASSIC PARK, is a perfect counterpoint to Streep's performance.",

        "6977":"I like the idea that a parent would actually try to find something out about homosexuality, rather than just run off to get drunk or commiserate with his friends.<br \/><br \/>Other than that, it's kind of just what it seems like: a little relic of a bygone era, an era in which some gay people thought that if uptight straight people just sat down and watched a drag marionette performance, we could all learn to love and understand one another!",
        "6978":"That did happen, as witness the several attempts against Hitler, most notably the Staffenberg plot which occurred as this film was coming out.",
        "6985":"Again the author introduces the film and the stories.<br \/><br \/>James Hayter, soon to have his signature role as Samuel Pickwick, is the hero in THE VERGER.",

        "7003":"Obviously,the Newspaper Comic Strip was one parent, providing the visual\/narrative method of story telling.<br \/><br \/>The other direct ancestor was the Pulp Magazine.",
        "7004":"So we had a top rated: Chemist, Lawyer, Construction Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Geologist-Archaeologist-Paleontologist, etc.<br \/><br \/>The Doc Savage stories were very popular in the 1930's and '40's, and were published into the middle '50's.",
        "7006":"It was veteran Stop-action Animator and Producer of top Special Effects films, Geoprge Pal, who did the film along with Warner Brothers.<br \/><br \/>When DOC SAVAGE, MAN OF BRONZE arrived in the Movie Houses, it boasted of a well casted team of actors, albeit a largely \"No Name\" as far familiarity with the viewers.",
        "7011":"A Message From Charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present.",
        "7012":"The kid is this story, Dickie Jordan (David Mendenhall) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades.",
        "7016":"Charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company, especially Peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he's been staying in one place at.",
        "7017":"Things take an unexpected turn, though, when Charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from England as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever (not so common in 1700).",
        "7023":"You have to love how they time the revelation of this news to him seconds before his first live report.",
        "7040":"Kudos to the writers for at least getting that theology correct and giving a good message.<br \/><br \/>Overall, it's a good-hearted film that should offend very few.",
        "7050":"Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a televison reporter who is so utterly obsessed in being the main anchor that he holds God to total culpability for his own contretemps.",
        "7052":"However, my premier kudos goes to Director Tom Shadyac for not letting the dog out of the house for #2, and showing us the most hilarious doggoned bathroom scene of all time!",
        "7053":"A director who knows comedy, can get the talent he gets, and can tell a meaningful and intelligent story with it is hard to find.<br \/><br \/>My biggest complaint is that they should have used more biblical references.",
        "7069":"It stars Lindsay Crouse as best-selling psychiatrist, Margaret Ford, who decides to confront the gambler who has driven one of her patients to contemplate suicide.",
        "7071":"The card game ensues and soon the psychiatrist and the gambler are seen to be in a familiar line of work (gaining the trust of others) and a fascinating relationship begins.",
        "7074":"How she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, Billy is a compulsive gambler.",
        "7076":"Wealthy psychiatrist Lindsay Crouse has just published her first novel and is feeling down about her profession feeling that it's hopeless to help her patients.",
        "7077":"Crouse is perfect as the uptight psychiatrist needing a change and Mantegna tops her as the devilishly sly con-man.",
        "7080":"I am relatively unaware of David Mamet's (writer and director) other works but after having watched this film half a dozen times(it's always a joy to watch), I can say without hesitation that he is a genius.",
        "7085":"Lindsay Crouse stars alongside him as the psychiatrist seduced by his work, and again is believable in her role.",

        "7094":"I cannot picture any other actor besides Mantegna playing the role of Mike, and Crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset.",
        "7106":"To paraphrase that: a given actor, the \"Cheers\" woman, the \"Tonight Show\" host, the Most Trusted Name In News, a famous chef, the \"Young Frankenstein\" police chief, Lisa Simpson, one of the Three Amigos and the CNN guy.<br \/><br \/>But I guess that I shouldn't focus only on the cast.",
        "7107":"Loui is actually just some middle class kid that needed to realize how lucky he was to have a loving family, and Cecelia was an upper class kid that just needed to prove to her family that she existed and they would miss her if she was gone.",
        "7109":"It's a great flick for kid and it does stick in your mind... makes you kinda think about how you treat people and it should be revisited every 10 years I think.",

        "7137":"When I found the movie in the schedule for Christmas, its title did not sound familiar to me since I have not read the novel and had not heard anything about the film.",
        "7139":"Recommended for anyone who has ever loved a parent, spouse, or family member--in other words, EVERYONE!<br \/><br \/>Though the production isn't quite Hollywood quality--no big special effects--still, the values and ideals portrayed more than make up for it.",
        "7140":"High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is.",
        "7148":"Nevertheless, he is supposed to represent an unwashed youth on a two-week train ride around Europe, so the look he has cultivated is probably pretty genuine.",
        "7154":"He is a promiscuous American writer, touring Europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; She is a young French student, on her way home to Paris.",
        "7155":"The fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.<br \/><br \/>All in all, Sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of Vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film I will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",
        "7190":"Conrad Vieght was such a great actor that he was able to continue this underlying \"evilness\" a few years later in \"Casablanca.\"",

        "10203":"\"Le Locataire\", or \"The Tenant\", is one of those movies; a horror\/suspense story about paranoia and obsession that is among his best works and probably among the best horror movies ever done.<br \/><br \/>Polanski himself plays Telkovsky, a young man looking for an apartment in France.",
        "10207":"I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide, and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight - so, needless to say, I can easily relate to Polanski's \"The Tenant.\"",

        "10214":"But The Tenant is not just confined spatially, but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist.",
        "10217":"The Tenant fits into neither of these categories \u0096 it simply immerses us completely inside Trelkovsky's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head.",
        "10222":"The Tenant is good, with no major flaws, and Polanski was really on top form as a director, but it's not among his most gripping works.",
        "10223":"What can be said, really... \"The Tenant\" is a first-class thriller wrought with equal amounts of suspense and full-blown paranoia.",
        "10224":"\"The Tenant,\" however, is more brooding and sinister, laced with unexpected comic relief, fine performances, and a truly haunting score.",
        "10232":"In my book Rosemary's Baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a sole character.",
        "10240":"\"The Tenant\" manages to balance darker than dark absurdity (I'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor, even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny) with some truly suspenseful paranoia.",
        "10242":"Polanski the actor is often overshadowed by Polanski the director, but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast.",
        "10243":"\"The Tenant\" is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both \"Repulsion\" and \"Rosemary's Baby\", but its just as brilliant as either of those classics.",
        "10247":"Suffice to say he collaborates with film composer Philippe Sarde and legendary director of photography Sven Nykvist (Bergman's DP) in the making of this movie.",
        "10252":"'The Tenant' is quite an interesting work by Polanski, one of the first of his European exile.",
        "10255":"The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat, and Trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend Stella (a spectacled Isabelle Adjani in her first role after Truffaut's 'L'histoire d'Adele H.').",
        "10258":"I like seeing films where the director is also apart of the main cast, to me it really highlights their fantastic versatility and talent, which I respect greatly.<br \/><br \/>One thing I didn't like about this film is how it was done in English.",
        "10260":"This film is a lot more open to interpretation than the other two films mentioned, which I think really strengthens this one in particular.",
        "10261":"If you liked Repulsion and\/or Rosemary's Baby, I guarantee you will enjoy this film to say the least.",
        "10266":"\"Le Locataire\"(\"The Tenant\")is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made.Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky,a timid file clerk living in Paris,who answers an advertisement for an apartment,only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window.Trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella(Isabelle Adjani).Trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and,at first,is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment.His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours,who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant's suicide.This film is great.Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia.Plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall,or the fever dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics.The photography by Sven Nykvist is truly beautiful.",
        "10267":"\"The Tenant\" is a neglected gem.It may be difficult to track down,but it is more than worth the effort.",
        "10270":"Polanski is certainly not a bad actor, but he seems to have bitten off more than he can chew with the difficult role of Trelkovsky.",
        "10282":"Certainly, an homage to women by the director Gustav Machat\u00fd, and a shock to 1933 audiences.<br \/><br \/>The only thing that mars this beautifully filmed movie is the excessive guilt, and a strange ending.",
        "10283":"Ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence, against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what Bernard Shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term 'The Lifeforce'.",
        "10285":"It is sub-titled and its Director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub-titles, and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward.",
        "10286":"The parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it.",
        "10288":"Czech director, Gustav Machaty (who directed the original screen version of 'Madam X',another parable in romantic obsession) directs from a screenplay by Jacques Koerpel,Frantisek Horky & Machaty,from the novel by Robert Horky.",
        "10297":"Brian Van Holt, Zorie Barber, and Jonathan Abrahams are three distinct, unrelenting sex-obsessed predators who along with the foil of their recently married buddy (superbly played by Judah Domke) are turned upside down on their own terms by a female predator (Amanda Peet).",
        "10298":"Peter Cohen, the director, has made a cutting edge film that shows the raw inside of men's egos in the urban dating world.",
        "10322":"My initial interest in the film was because of two factors: 1) the Marblehead film location in my hometown and, 2) the fact that my grandmother Lizzette M. Woodfin was hired as a stand-in for Mary Pickford during filming of several scenes including the \"cliff scene\".",
        "10325":"Star Pickford and director Tourneur -- along with his two favorite cameramen and assistant Clarence Brown doing the editing -- bring great beauty and intelligence to this story of poor, isolated Scottish Islanders -- the same territory that Michael Powell would stake twenty years later for his first great success.",
        "10333":"Director Frank Wisbar obviously knows a good story when he writes one and what's more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen.",
        "10339":"Over the coming weeks the child revisits the place where she found her fox hopeful that one of said days she will see said fox, who she begins to call Lily, once again.",
        "10340":"A young, seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and walks to school, seemingly on her own, every day, seemingly without a care in the a seemingly perfect world.",
        "10345":"Here, the child meets the elegant fox near her home up in the mountains, which provide for plenty of beautiful picture-postcard perfect shots that a cinematographer will have to go into overdrive to capture.<br \/><br \/>But while we indulge in wistful scenery, the characters don't get to establish that level of trust from the onset, and we have to wait a few seasons to past, and 45 minutes into the film, before they find a leveler in food.",
        "10346":"The child persistently attempts at striking a bond with the objective of taming the creature for her own amusement, but the fox, well, as other notions of course.",
        "10348":"The story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around, when you know where it's headed.<br \/><br \/>Still, as I said, the story is incidental.",
        "10359":"When I was a kid in the 1960s, Che's image was everywhere; on bedroom wall posters, on T shirts, on magazine covers.",
        "10366":"Director Steven Soderbergh, and newbie commie (sorry Steven, but I had to take Soder shots here) divides the movie in two partes on Commander Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara's revolutionary life.",
        "10374":"I will buy it and judge for myself.<br \/><br \/>Story is basically a Nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies.",
        "10377":"The story is about a Vietnam vet (Kris Kristofferson) being recruited by his brother (Jan-Michael Vincent) to help clean up the criminal element in a small town and what happens when Kris starts taking advantage of his position and becomes as bad as the criminals he was hired to get rid of.",
        "10383":"However, Kristofferson is a good enough actor, and charismatic enough, to carry this villain with a surprising depth.",
        "10384":"However, this was a movie as a child that I was a fervent admirer of; keeping in mind now that it was made for children, I rate it on a relative basis.",
        "10387":"He stops in church to pray at one point and expresses his emotions so openly and so well that the character has you crying before the damn movie even gets really started.",
        "10388":"If you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of it.",
        "10393":"Every actor in every role is terrific, especially a wise and understated Jamie Lee Curtis, a tightly wound and anguished Ray Liotta, and a heart-stopping turn from Tom Hulce that should have had him up for every award in the book.",
        "10408":"Though Dominick's instinct to save the baby can be understood, we also see how damaging this response is.",
        "10414":"(i.e he goes to church, loves Hulk Hogan) Geno loves Nicky more than anything in the world.",
        "10424":"In fact, the Japanese director took pains to remake the same movie as it was in the original, the only difference was the casting of American actors.",
        "10429":"The director knows exactly what he's doing, and I believe he got his vision through as he wanted it.<br \/><br \/>I gave this film 8 of 10.",
        "10430":"Karen goes into a Japanese house as a substitute nurse to Emma, a strange woman who sleeps at day and wakes at night.",
        "10434":"It's a very creative made movie, that despite its simplicity still at all times feel as a totally original and cleverly constructed movie, that never seizes to entertain.<br \/><br \/>The last half hour is especially unforgettably fun, without spoiling too much, and is really among the greatest, as well as most creative moments in early comedy film-making.<br \/><br \/>The movie is filled with some really enjoyable characters, who are of course all very stereotypical and silly and were obviously cast because of their looks.",
        "10444":"He was more of less, a mixed up kid that got what he got through his \"large\" endowment.",
        "10445":"Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in John's life into a nightmare for all of us watching.",
        "10452":"<br \/><br \/>The director does not introduce one single likable individual among the cast.",
        "10454":"Unless you have an interest in these murders or were a \"fan\" of John Holmes, this really isn't a film to see.",
        "10462":"Besides being a legendary adult film actor, Holmes was as also a hardcore drug addict who befriended various Hollywood junkies.",
        "10463":"Director James Cox sometime proved to be a bit of a coxsucker by displaying a vast amount of overextended scenes, just like Holmes' famous organ.",

        "10517":"Director Robert M. Young doesn't shy away from the uglier and more exploitative elements of the situation; the film does become uncomfortable to watch at times.",

        "10529":"Baker as his put-upon sister also has some delicate moments - when DeNiro gives her flowers in one scene, it seems like she was never given flowers before and probably wasn't.",
        "10538":"As a vet (not from Vietnam) I can relate to the situations brought by both Harris and De Niro.",
        "10540":"Different from movies like \"Taxi driver\" or \"Rambo\" which use to present their main characters as broken heroes in a bad after war environment this movie allows the audience to face a different view on the Vietnam vets.",

        "10588":"Also, the director must have had the patience of a saint when it came to filming the kiddy Bad sequence as usually directors hate working with one kid let alone a whole bunch of them performing a complex dance scene.<br \/><br \/>Bottom line, this movie is for people who like MJ on one level or another (which i think is most people).",

        "10657":"I saw this as a child on TV somewhere and was amazed by the scene where Sammi comes on stage and plays Trick or Treat by Fastway.<br \/><br \/>The movie itself was typical 80's, guy gets pushed around by bullies and enlists supernatural help to beat up the bullies but goes to far and has to be destroyed.<br \/><br \/>Matt from Melrose Place picks on Skippy from Family Ties so Skippy gets a record of Tony Fields from Gene Simmons to comfort him and all hell breaks lose, the highlight being where Tony sings (lip-synchs) and dances to a metal song before the shyt hits the fan.<br \/><br \/>There were a lot of errors and stuff but the music and the overall imagery was enough to keep my fists pumping 8 out of 10",

        "11595":"Pope, incompetent against Lee and Jackson, turned out to be quite effective here, and the revolt was smashed.<br \/><br \/>However, with all Lincoln's actual attention to western problems, it is doubtful that he says (as Cooper repeats at least once), \"The frontier should be secure.\"",
        "11603":"The chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by George Antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'Bad Boy of Music'.",
        "11605":"Susan Sarandon is such a good actor, that she made an interesting, strong character out of mediocre writing.",
        "11613":"Over one Christmas, on a rare week when Channel 4 in the UK showed a week of Hong Kong movies, Zu Warriors was so gripping for a very young viewer and his brother and so memorable, that it's been etched into the memory of the now grown up sprog...<br \/><br \/>In fact, I think the original Zu Warriors is one of the earliest films I saw as a kid that I can clearly recall the story line and action scenes from.",
        "11627":"Except for an awkward scene, this refreshing fairy tale fantasy has a fun and delightful undercurrent of adult cynical wit that charms its way into the audience as well as a soundtrack that powerfully moves this fairy epic along.",

        "11641":"It's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which I haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s.",
        "11664":"The interest of Saura on the bridge between classical and contemporary music and dance is one more ingredient in turning this movie maybe the most aesthetically exciting among his other works.",
        "11665":"Now it still deserves inclusion to honor a great director and a great cinematic conservator of Spanish culture, but he has done a lot like this before, and though we can applaud the riches he has given us, we have to pick and choose favorites and high points among similar films which include Blood Wedding (1981), Carmen (1983), El Amore Brujo (1986), Sevillanas (1992), Salom\u00e9 (2002) and Tango (1998).",

        "11848":"And unlike the teen sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgement High), the movie holds up well against time.<br \/><br \/>Its theme of teen angst is as relevant today as it was 25 years ago and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (remember him?)",
        "11854":"The energy level is high, with co-story author and director Allan Arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings.",

        "11877":"Tess Nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so I think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film.",
        "11880":"A talented filmmaker and writer (she made this film right after her High School Graduation), she has real potential and will be one to watch in the upcoming future.<br \/><br \/>As I watched this short film I was constantly uncomfortable; between the music, bleak scenery, and realistic portrayal of an insomniac by Dominic Monaghan (as Jack), I desperately wanted to turn this off at times just to escape from it.",

        "11906":"Russell Boyd, Weir's longtime DP who won an Oscar in 2004 for Master and Commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mystery.<br \/><br \/>I also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines, it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions, like Dances With Wolves or The Last Samurai.",
        "11908":"This time there are Christmas themed opening & closing Crypt Keeper (John Kassir) segments complete with the usual puns.<br \/><br \/>Director Zemeckis does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of Christmas influence as well.",
        "11909":"It is the very first Christmas episode, about a woman who is tormented by a serial killer dressed as Santa after having killed her own husband.",
        "11910":"Director Robert (\"Back to the Future\") Zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by Fred (\"Night of the Creeps,\" \"The Monster Squad\") Dekker which centers on a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by Mary Ellen Trainor, who was married to Zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband (a nice cameo by Marshall Bell) on Christmas Eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire-poker.",
        "11913":"Every film student, writer, or simply anyone willing to handle a 3 hour film with no abrupt cuts, no music video overstyling, no soap opera-like plot twists, and no banal dialogue should make it a point to see this movie.",
        "11916":"Director Jean Eustache is not as well known as other directors from the New Wave, but he should be.<br \/><br \/>There is no improvisation (unlike in John Cassavetes's similar films made in the US) and the dialogue comes from real-life conversations.",
        "11919":"It is well possible that the director had a gargantuan satire in mind against the idle running of the once so hotly discussed political and sociological ideas, but the type of man Alexandre exists to all times, we find him already in Petron's \"Satiricon\", which work has actually great resemblance with \"The Mother and the Whore\".<br \/><br \/>Alexandre does not only nothing, but he has developed an own kind of metaphysics about the absence of acting, at least acting in the sense of responsibility toward the society whose part he is.",
        "11929":"And in this tiny nurse's room, Alexandre looks more like Albertine than Marcel.<br \/><br \/>To explain this failure, we can say that Alexandre is a Balzac's reader.",
        "11938":"Common interpretation is that the movie criticises the mere possibility of \"liberated love\" by depicting the unwanted implications on the people involved.",
        "11948":"Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball, I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of.",
        "11954":"Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious adjuncts to the action, and insure that viewers don't hit the fast-forward button between the physical clashes.<br \/><br \/>The opening scene, which features a funny light sabre duel, sets a solid but deceptive tone.",
        "11956":"Sammo is interested in local baker girl Ping (Nina Li Chi) while Max one day meets a mysterious and beautiful Fennie Yuen Kit-Ying he falls madly in love with.",
        "11963":"I still have to work out the director's psychological motive for the sub plot in the role of the parole officer and some of the subtle nuances of camera work are worth a second look.",
        "11973":"This small French film centers on put upon office secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) who spends her days doing other men's jobs, uncredited, and being the source of their scorn and lunchtime conversation which is all too clear to her as, being partially deaf, she reads lips.",
        "11979":"The sexual tension that brews between a secretary and a criminal is almost palpable even without hardly any physical contact.",
        "11985":"Director Jacques Audiard with and co-writer Tonino Benacquista have created a tense, tight, completely entertaining little thriller that makes some significant statements about out of the norm individuals and their plights.<br \/><br \/>Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is a plain Jane, mostly deaf, thirty something unnoticed secretary for a company whose life is one of social and sexual isolation and whose view of the future is rather bleak.",
        "11986":"Director Audiard wisely manipulates a factor that is at once sensitive and transformative for the story: he shows us the difference between 'hearing' the world with and without hearing aids and in doing so makes some powerful social comments.",
        "11988":"Deaf secretary Carla (Emmanuelle Devos) is bullied by her mean spirited male colleagues.<br \/><br \/>When they suggest she needs an assistant it seems like the final insult, but, when the first applicant is ex-con Paul (Vincent Cassel) she seizes the chance to change her life.<br \/><br \/>Carla covers his mistakes and he, anxious to go straight, reluctantly helps her to take revenge on her colleagues.<br \/><br \/>When Paul asks Carla to return the favor, she finds herself drawn into the criminal underworld, ruled by ruthless lone shark Marchand (Olivier Gourmet).<br \/><br \/>Recognizing her ability to lip-read as a weapon no one will have bargained for, the two set out to see justice done.<br \/><br \/>French filmmaker Jacques Audiard's third feature \"Read My Lips\" is a genre-defying piece, switching from dark social comedy to visceral full-throttle thriller.",
        "11998":"Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life : but the guy is just coming out from jail.",

        "12064":"By Annakin's revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side (in his helmet) and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker (by removing the helmet).",
        "12078":"Emperor Palpatine (portrayed by the amazing theater actor Ian McDiarmid) was one the best parts of the movie.",
        "12092":"For once, the director of a MacDowell film did not make her beauty another character in the film.",
        "12099":"However, the girl is resold to the farmer Louren\u00e7o (Ot\u00e1vio Augusto) that deflowers her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience.",
        "12101":"Director and writer Rudi Lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes.",
        "12102":"It's unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film, and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources.",
        "12108":"The story follows a DJ, his younger breakdancing brother, a graffiti artist and a wanna-be showbiz promoter through one winter in which they try to break out of the ghetto using their \"street\" talent.",
        "12112":"With the departure of its lead actor and the defeat of the Goa'uld and the Replicators in Season Eight, many fans felt the series should go out on a high.",
        "12116":"Christopher Judge is excellent as the aloof Teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety.",
        "12121":"It was a well shot movie, the director used the right colors in this movie(dark blue colors) to give it the right kind of feel.",
        "12135":"Its right after Kid Wichita kills the sheriff, and goes to Jack Elams place trying to goad him into a fight.",
        "12136":"Jim, AKA Kid Wichita, has a way of making things happen, only trouble is, he usually leaves dead bodies where he's been.",
        "12150":"Even as a kid, I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales; horrible things happen to people in most children's books.",
        "12169":"It was a stop-motion clay animation about a kid who's depressed and playing guitar and singing the blues in his room.",
        "12171":"As a parent, if this were a U.S. film, I would be up in arms about such things, although not necessarily the moral lessons drawn at the end of the picture, which, of course, are also not black and white.",
        "12172":"Some kid becomes \"The one\" and in the end has almost no relevance to a yokai war that makes no sense whatsoever anyway.",
        "12179":"It is truly a joy to see an actor ply his trade so well, to be able to make a character so real, from every word he utters down to the finest expression of his face, and to make it all ring so true.",
        "12180":"A flawless presentation, this version of `A Christmas Carol' sets the standard against which all others must be gauged; no matter how many versions you may have seen, watching this one is like seeing it for the first time ever.",
        "12186":"The 1984 version of A Christmas Carol should be a required part of every household's celebration of the holiday.",
        "12188":"It is a movie I watch every Christmas along with the real Grinch and It's A Wonderful Life.",
        "12192":"The scene Christmas Morning when Scrooge realizes he hasn't 'missed it', is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act versus overact.",
        "12193":"The Tiny Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a little tough to look at, almost too sweet.",
        "12194":"As the celebration of Christmas has evolved through the years, whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other.",
        "12219":"Although George C. Scott is the only actor in this version of ACC without a British accent, he more than makes up for it with his over-the-top and larger-than-life interpretation of Ebenezer Scrooge.<br \/><br \/>Particularly effective is when he confronts Bob Cratchit in his office at the movie's end.",
        "12221":"It was the year my first child was born, and seeing A Christmas Carol in this incarnation brings back fond memories of happy times -- many hours of which were spent with this film playing in the background.",

        "12246":"The story and Director Dave Fleischer both afforded a plethora of comic strip-like situations and sight gags that seemed most appropriate for the character of little Henry.",
        "12251":"Although the first, POPEYE THE SAILOR (Fleischer\/Paramount, 1933), was the most successful (and barely had any Betty Boop in it, save for a cameo as a carnival hula dancer); the HENRY Short was much better than the two following King Features \"tryouts\", BETTY BOOP AND THE LITTLE KING and BETTY BOOP AND LITTLE JIMMY, both 1936.<br \/><br \/>POODLE SCHNITZ!",
        "12252":"HOWEVER, having just seen 'Finding John Christmas' and its predecessor, 'A Town Without Christmas', for the first time within a week of each other, I have to say that 'Max', Peter's Falk's delightful character in both movies, is surely as memorable and lovable as 'Columbo'.",
        "12253":"Valerie Bertinelli plays Kathleen McAllister, a divorced small-town nurse whose depression... over the fact that the hospital ER she maintains may be forced to shut down because of a $100,000 debt is briefly lifted when she spots a newspaper picture taken by photojournalist Noah Greeley (David Cubitt).",
        "12267":"Director has definitely given it much thought and actors have done it to perfection.Though the movie is slow,you don't mind it,because you kind of get so much involved with the story that you just wanna continue watching the joy of this newly engaged couple.",

        "12277":"I liked not only that the director was brave enough to make a movie where younger generation might not relate to the concept (of arranged marriage), but also that he did it with a conviction (that it is the right thing to do).",
        "12284":"She is the head writer of the show, and she and Celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years.",
        "12291":"Now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating Laurie Craven, the show's new ingenue; so he's not leaving.<br \/><br \/>Beautiful Elizabeth Shue (as Laurie) rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well.",
        "12297":"Kathy Najimy is wonderful as the hapless costume designer, and best of all, Cathy Moriarty as Nurse Nan who leads the plot to get Fields character removed from the show is hilarious.<br \/><br \/>This movie should have won Oscars for best comedy, best leading lady in a comedy, best leading man in a comedy and myriad other bests, including writing, directing and supporting actors and actresses.",

        "12328":"The ending is so abrupt you almost think the director ran out of film; it's also a study in despair.",
        "12350":"And she has shaped the bitter adolescent personality that we all had, into a corrosive, adult world-view.",
        "12359":"The architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed.",

        "12414":"Jessica Alba is not the worst actor in the world, but she does come up short in terms of being convincing when the story needs it least.<br \/><br \/>The good news is that the premise and the production values are all top-notch.",

        "13360":"Alain Chabat is a fine actor, writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when Aristophanes was still learning that it's 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'.",
        "13363":"From the opening shots of the lead actor, we are given a early view on how so many mens lives are run by the women in them, and the humour that comes thru with all that goes on in the day to day of 'normal' life.<br \/><br \/>Eric Lartigau, the director picks up on how so many European men feel that they are in complete control of their lives, yet without the help\/support of the women around them cannot seem to make things work.",

        "13369":"Using a simple movie language, director Slobodan Sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (World War I), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the Great War veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a German spy.<br \/><br \/>Brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the Gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (Sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define Serbian cinematography of the 1980s: \"Maratonci trce pocasni krug\", \"Kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota\", and my other director's favourite \"Davitelj protiv davitelja\").",

        "13505":"Director Sogo Ishii handles this one as an epic, with measured pace, camera work always stylish and often frenzied, without neglecting the need for more sedate moments to let the location sink in, there is also great use of lighting and fog to give an ethereal atmosphere, there is an air of fantasy to much of the film but outside of the overtly supernatural moments it is a down and dirty fantasy with more period fell than flights of fancy.",
        "13506":"The mentioned scenes are derived from certain interpretations of Mahayana Buddhist text (Mahayana Buddhism can be found in China, Korea and Japan) and the other scene deals with a quirk in the Japanese calendar...people back then really thought that the world would come to an end...

        "13680":"Josephine Baker was on the verge of a comeback when she died of a stroke in 1975, at the age of 68.<br \/><br \/>Having appeared in only two decent films - ZOUZOU & PRINCESSE TAM TAM - Baker is in danger of becoming obscure.",
        "13683":"Pay attention to Alwina's (Baker) placement within shots, how she is addressed by the other characters, the settings around her that all depict her as a \"savage\" African, and ask yourself if Alwina has any shred of agency throughout the film.",

        "13764":"The youngster portraying 'Frits' the lead character has an astonishingly open face which mirrors with painful accuracy the tragic events which unfold around him.<br \/><br \/>Early on in the film we see that the father whom Frits loves so much has mental health problems and this is brought up when the brutal headmaster denies assaulting the boy and suggests it was his own father.<br \/><br \/>The climactic scene where Frits refuses to show any respect to the headmaster; simply standing his ground and repeating 'Liar' as he is brutally assaulted in front of his classmates is a scene you are not likely to forget.<br \/><br \/>The films only weak point is the rather clich\u00e9d 'Flower Power' teacher who uses every 'friendly teacher' trick in the book.",

        "13930":"The Director appears to immediately realise who the most interesting inmates were in Sammie (and later, Hal) and allows a longer, more in depth observation into the man and his personality.",

        "14989":"\"The Dentist\" turned that around.<br \/><br \/>The setup seems simple: a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths, and perhaps bodies as well.",
        "14990":"A clever twist, though, is that the dentist is the film's protagonist, so instead of being some one-dimensional bad guy with no clear motivation, his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable.",

        "15035":"Adapted from Wells' somewhat different work by the author, it presents a look at the human future with the subject of periods of war as versus periods of 'peace'.",
        "15039":"The film hasn't got much interest in subtle complexities; it goes for barnstorming spectacle and unsubtle, blunt moralism, every time.",
        "15042":"The cinematographer and Mr Richardson really do salvage things however; respectively creating an awed sense of wonder at technology, and an engaging, jerky performance that consistently beguiles.",
        "15043":"The art director was the great William Cameron Menzies, and his sets of the ruins of Everytown are among his best work.",
        "15049":"The little boy wanting to be a good soldier like his daddy is an image that will likely always stay with me.",

        "15067":"There's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of The Wanderng Sickness is wonderfully realised .",
        "15072":"But remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he\/she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so Aragorn is realized with a distinctive Native American feel and Boromir appears in Viking inspired garb.",
        "15074":"We will never be able to see Bakshi's interpretation of Gondor, of Shelob, of Faramir, of the Cracks of Doom, of Eowyn's battle with the Witch King or Gandalf's confrontation with him.",
        "15081":"But there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more.",
        "15095":"The only actor who seemed inappropriate was Michael Scholes as Sam, whose voice acting was irritating and added to Sam's unfortunately silly image.",
        "15128":"The director and his associates, particularly cinematographer Joseph H. August, turned this to their advantage in creating a claustrophobic masterpiece about a man at war with himself.",
        "15144":"Veteran action director Steve Carver keeps it moving and delivers a respectable amount of gunfire, explosions, and general all-out mayhem.<br \/><br \/>\"Bulletproof\" is good fun for the action fan who doesn't mind switching off their brain now and then and just enjoying a generous assortment of violence and humor.<br \/><br \/>7\/10",

        "15188":"The filmmakers' interpretation of the Wendigo's form is interesting, and can be properly menacing when filmed correctly - when the fleeing killer sees the Wendigo in a flash in his rear view mirror, for instance - and the tree-form was actually very good.",

        "20272":"Again, a great choice by the creative team that only heightens the viewing experience by not taking things too \"over the top\".<br \/><br \/>Though i do not recognize any \"big names\" in the cast, the voice actors manage to deliver a satisfying performance; keeping the delivery of every line realistically subdued and only hamming it up in the case of the bad guys.<br \/><br \/>Did i say bad guys??",

        "20305":"Carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.<br \/><br \/>Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date.",

        "20310":"He is pursued the whole time by a psychiatrist (Donald Pleasence) who knows just how evil this young man is.<br \/><br \/>It opens with a bang, and sets up a genuinely suspenseful and atmospheric chiller that is actually superior to the many slasher pictures it helped to inspire.",

        "20323":"Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next.",
        "20324":"Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.<br \/><br \/>Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling.",
        "20327":"This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.<br \/><br \/>This film may seem clich\u00e9 today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this.",

        "20340":"Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt!",
        "20342":"Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage!",
        "20346":"As a kid, I remember I really enjoyed the sequels, especially The Return of Michael Myers, which I still think is the best Halloween sequel.",
        "20348":"As I mentioned previously, John Carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies I can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic Conan the Barbarian).",

        "22355":"Hard to believe the director didn't suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw.<br \/><br \/>Ironically, her winning performance in \"Mad Men\" comes as a character who, at least in her early appearances, is very repressed, reserved, unsure of herself, and rather colorless, not unlike her \"Taboo\" role.",
        "22358":"A few interesting shots aside, the director tries far too hard with far too little success, awkward tracking shots and jittery camera-work distracting from what little element of story there is.<br \/><br \/>Three of this movie's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains Amber Benson, and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit.",

        "22390":"Special effects aren't stellar, but the director seems to be mostly competent enough to work around that weakness.<br \/><br \/>The lead, a mildly charismatic male that seems to be attempting a blended channeling of Tom Cruise and Christopher Reeves, reminded me mostly of Matt Dillon's character in 'Wild Things'.",

On a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, PhD or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle?",

        "22563":"The director (Fred Olen Ray), who has specialized in making over one hundred low-grade films (most notably \"Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers\"), does what he does best and throws together a plot that only half makes sense and gives us rudimentary special effects.",

        "22627":"Christopher Lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor I like Lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films Clue and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and I am fond of Back To The Future) but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.<br \/><br \/>Overall, as much I wanted to like this movie, I was left unimpressed.",

        "22656":"Her function in the film as the love interest of Rios affirms that the European way is the right way, simply because they are European.",
        "22657":"It's really just left to the assumption that the viewer is meant to associate themselves with the Europeans over the Aztec because their dress, language, ideology, etc is more familiar to them than the Aztec - so therefore the Aztec are portrayed as adversarial and 'backwards.'",
        "22658":"There is also a scene where we have the Christian holy man noting the achievements of the Aztec: \"They have agriculture, medicine, calendar, etc.\"",

        "22675":"The writer (whom I assume is also the director) writes each character like they are auditioning for a comic book villain.<br \/><br \/>The overall production value is pretty good, but to be honest, with a film this bad it's easy to overlook it.",
        "22677":"Again, it seemed as if the director was just throwing in songs in the film in an effort to \"be cool\".<br \/><br \/>Which brings me to my final point.",

        "22752":"Branagh has always been a pretty lousy director: grindingly literal-minded; star-struck; unforgivably ungenerous to his fellow actors (he loves his American stars, but loves himself more, making damn sure that he gets all the good lines).<br \/><br \/>Along those lines, the sad fact remains that *Love's Labour's Lost* is scarcely worse than the interminable, ghastly, bloated *Hamlet* from 1996.",
        "22758":"Instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the King, thus an unimposing so-called King with no Kingly attributes.",

        "22770":"As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clich\u00e9s are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on.",
        "22772":"Even straight-to-DVD movies such as BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE (which has a very low IMDb rating) have a lot of redeeming qualities and sometimes come off as being one of the so-called \"so bad, they're good\" movies.",
        "22774":"She is attractive and might develop into an actor but she took on too many tasks in this movie.",
        "22787":"In his brief 40 years on Earth, author Jack London managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible.",
        "22794":"Instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him.",
        "22796":"It's too bad that his Christian upbringing traumatized him, but he needn't subject an audience to his coping mechanism.",

        "22804":"I also strongly doubt that any of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords or even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.<br \/><br \/>With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity.",

        "22808":"It's as if director Brian Flemming only recently discovered both atheism and sarcasm, and feels with these tools he can easily bludgeon his opposition.<br \/><br \/>Also, Flemming wanders extensively into his own personal issues, and they take over the movie.",
        "22811":"This is anathema to Christianity which believes that a Church hierarchy including priests and bishops all the way up to the Pope are required to interpret God's will to mankind.<br \/><br \/>Although I am not a Christian and have some doubts about whether or not Jesus Christ was in fact a historical figure, the truth is that, in the long scheme of things, it may not matter.",

        "22883":"Within the first 17 minutes of director Bradford May's \"Darkman III: Die Darkman Die\", we have already been subjected to a silly recap and accompanying voice-over on the first two films, hilarious over-acting, about three minutes of footage simply ripped from the second film and re-edited slightly to seem like new footage, and a lengthy advertisement the scarred and tormented title character watches about Universal Theme Parks- Universal being the company that distributed this film.",
        "22884":"Also, while no Danny Elfman, composer Randy Miller composes some nice music that builds off of Elfman's original themes.<br \/><br \/>But overall, the film is too quick, cheap and silly to be taken seriously.",

        "22961":"\"Jesus Christ Superstar\" is my favourite movie about Jesus's last days (\"The Passion of the Christ\" is way too graphic), though I like how \"Jesus of Nazareth\", instead of just ending with Jesus's death, continues on and shows his resurrection.",

        "23045":"To the writer's credit, this issue was treated as a problem, and a May-December match is not portrayed as the right-and-good inevitability of some Mary Pickford films (e.g., \"Daddy-Long-Legs\").",

        "23414":"Oddly, Carpenter never has been anything more than a B director, but at least such films as 'Fog' and 'The Thing' had terrific atmosphere (the latter is one of my cult favorites).<br \/><br \/>Abominable acting.",

        "23456":"I think that this season Mr Carpenter managed to make something so grey-area that you can't immediately see if he is pro-choice or anti-abortion.",
        "23458":"I'm not sure if Carpenter is looking to raise questions on abortion, and make the really heavy-handed and obvious point that a woman should be allowed an abortion if Satan is the father, but it drags on and on.",
        "23460":"After learning his baby is dead, does the devil destroy the abortion clinic and kill everyone in a huge, bloody, gory, uproar?",

        "23482":"Because the film is \"Christian,\" this is predictable, as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the \"end times\" without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with Christianity.",
        "23483":"There are certainly plenty of Christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the \"Left Behind\" series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being best-sellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology.<br \/><br \/>As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though I have yet to finish the last two books of the series.",
        "23484":"However, this series is divisive in Christian circles because it promotes the \"literalist\" interpretation of all Scripture above a more proper hermeneutic.",
        "23485":"As a Christian body, on the whole, we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others.<br \/><br \/>Thus, the \"Left Behind\" movies fail because the \"Left Behind\" books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies.",

        "23573":"The director and writer seemed to think he was a nothing figure with no fanbase, though I doubt any Mojo magazine reading, country-rock 70's music fan would agree.",
        "23575":"How dare a (second rate) director and writer attempt something to which they're so clearly incapable of delivering.",
        "23576":"And then I discovered the director was an Irishman who's most noteworthy recent work is a really lousy BBC Sunday night drama called Monarch of the Glen (trust me, it's lowest common denominator TV).",

        "23608":"Clay seems to think a generation of crazed youth are made evil by scenes of war on our TVs.",
        "23612":"I felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible.",
        "23617":"It seems to me as if the director tried to push this question into the crowd's head : \"what are such crimes compared to horror of war and extermination ?\"",
        "23618":"The director pretends to describe that, - but is not good in that.<br \/><br \/>The director used several times the word the 'selfishness' of people, mentioning for instance the teacher.",
        "23619":"Dreadful acting and an ending that the Director appeared to contrive out of nowhere as the film had frankly been nothing short of dull.",
        "23623":"If the director considers what I saw in the last couple of minutes as great ecstasy, I have to say that that's not even close.<br \/><br \/>The use of cinematography is also not mature.",
        "23625":"In fact, the actor playing St.John in this adaptation played a passionate St.John while Scott is content to smash things or just stare at the ceiling (which he does all the time).",
        "23632":"Characters such as Grace Poole and Mason are never even introduced, leaving one to wonder if they'd dozed off for a few minutes during the movie.<br \/><br \/>The DVD we saw was produced by Platinum Disc Corp and even at $6.32 it was a gyp.<br \/><br \/>Be careful which version of this movie you buy!",
        "23641":"Having been a TV reporter at the time of these events, I was stunned that I had never heard anything about the bizarre behavior of Secretary Haig as portrayed by Richard Dreyfuss.",
        "23660":"The result is a completely forgettable first-half Christmas party where hardly anything happens and where even the dancing (the little that there is of it) isn't particularly memorable.<br \/><br \/>The pantomime over-acting, particularly of Drosselmeier, which might look passable on the stage, just looks silly filmed for the big screen.<br \/><br \/>Unfortunately, things aren't much better when we get to the Kingdom of Sweets (Act II in the stage version).",
        "23671":"The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast.",

        "23684":"Director Warren Beatty's intention to turn Chester Gould's famous comic strip into a live-action cartoon (with Beatty himself cast in the lead as the square-jawed detective) had sweet overtures of innocent nostalgia--quite unusual and intriguing coming from Warren Beatty.",

        "24118":"The \"sparkling\" bullets, the reporter with \"ninja\" like moves, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible.",

        "26154":"\"The Garden of Allah\" is a prime example of \"popular women's literature\", turn of the XXth century style, combining all the power of unbridled erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamour of fake mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of Catholic guilt.",
        "26170":"In this final movie for legendary actor, Edward G. Robinson, \"Solent Green\" becomes a landmark classic.",
        "26182":"I think the director made the first 5 episodes seem so much like a recap of the original just to give the viewer a small reminder and an introduction to characters and their deeds done because they appear much less after the series kicks into Spark's story.",

        "26469":"This director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres, including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre.",

        "26513":"Peter O'Brian, the director, probably saw a lot of the invaders from California that this movie seems to be the right way to deal with the arriving personalities trying to capitalize on the economics that Canada presented.<br \/><br \/>Needless to say, \"Moon Lantern\", the successful novel written by a Canadian author is turned into \"Flight to Bogota\", which has nothing to do with the original film.",
        "26522":"After a few years, the baby is a young boy (named Toto) and the adoptive mother is dying.",
        "26524":"Once again, this director brings together a wonderful cast of everyday people (not actors) and gets a great ensemble-type performance.",
        "26530":"It's very sentimental and more like a fairy tale, and should probably be classed as a comedy, although it deals with serious matters (a little like Chaplin or 1930-comedy).",

        "26599":"Yes, a love interest develops but it serves to enhance the plot, coming across more of an interesting inter-human reaction with its own fight related consequences.<br \/><br \/>All in all this is a great little sleeper movie that few seem to have heard of.",

        "26628":"No character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again!<br \/><br \/>I thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties.",
        "26632":"The author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of Mary Godwin Shelley and the other participants of this story.<br \/><br \/>If you are a person who loves history (even the little inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the gothic, then this is a movie for you.",
        "26633":"Romantic, yes, but completely rekindles my interest in the lives of Shelley and Byron every time I think about the film.",
        "26634":"Because Christian films tend to speak in a language that is different to those they want to share their faith to.",
        "26635":"And though Christians believe that salvation is available to those that seek it, we are still challenged by the everyday horrors of this life.",
        "26641":"I think, what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers, how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic, simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another.",
        "26642":"In any case, the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine' in this world that awaits all wounded souls, regardless of their religious orientation.",
        "26643":"However, given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie, I think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an Evangelist \u0096 basher!",

        "26658":"Some people say they quit attending church worship service after they watched Secret Sunshine, and Lee Chang-dong responds by saying, \"They were already anti-Christ before they watched this movie.",
        "26678":"The reasons for church going are many I suppose, either to find inner peace, to seek help, being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of Hell, to reaffirm faith, or even things like wanting to get married in a church, or to skirt chase (I kid you not).",
        "26683":"An ancient prophecy, a bunch of underdog heroes and a cute princess in search of her hero... sounds familiar...?",

        "26685":"The world is so creative, so uniquely beautiful, with a sort of muted storybook look to it.",

        "26751":"Director Jos\u00e9 Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations, and they're shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola.",
        "26755":"The ever-brilliant Max Von Sydow plays a Russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest.",
        "26763":"The psychiatrist Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky, wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail, and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union, is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland.",
        "26774":"Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation, who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government, in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society.<br \/><br \/>The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society, and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia, which is subtly put across.",
        "26775":"It's good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only \"based upon actual events,\" for a docudrama this ain't.<br \/><br \/>***SPOILERS FOLLOW****<br \/><br \/>That said, this is a damn good example of a fast-paced Hollywood-style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened.",
        "26778":"And yes, Chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor, Gorbunov, but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky (though Gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film).",
        "26786":"The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky(Max Von Sydow), who termed the UNSUB `CitizenX'.",
        "26788":"Steven Rea plays a forensic scientist thrust on the job in Sovie Russia in 1982..in the very first hours of his job a body of a murdered girl is brought in..he has his workers go back to look for evidence and they bring back five more bodies..this starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in modern day history..It is a stark depressing dark movie that explores how the bureaucracy of the old Soviet Union indirectly contributed or caused the deaths of many of the killers victims.It also explores in Donald Sutherland's character how the proper usage of bureaucracy in a communist govt can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster A gripping movie not for all but for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten.. 9",
        "26796":"Every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them, but for Jake (Anthony De Marco \u0096 of the forthcoming Clint Eastwood film CHANGELING - who resembles Henry Thomas circa 1982) the combination may prove deadly.",
        "26803":"It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten, clich\u00e9d line and make it sound vaguely believable.",

        "26847":"I think it was the author's intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior, in the end karma will come back to haunt them.",
        "26849":"Although Visconti's compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well-developed, the spider web of deceit is tenuous--although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale, Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it--the cosmic irony too didactic, the illicit relationship strained with bathos.",
        "26853":"Apparently, the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story--perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties!",
        "26859":"The \"women's director\" has a sure touch on the many documentary-like sequences of Air Corps training, and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed, particularly in wartime.",
        "26861":"I saw this movie once as a kid on the late-late show and fell in love with it.<br \/><br \/>It took 30+ years, but I recently did find it on DVD - it wasn't cheap, either - in a catalog that specialized in war movies.",

        "27008":"My post-post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography, stained-glass, ceramics, metal forging\/welding, and art drawing that also included silk screening.<br \/><br \/>I also keep healthy with jogging, walking and lately, hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah, Arizona, and Nevada.",
        "27023":"By using the flashback technique, director Claire Denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage, giving the viewer the sense that Chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside.",
        "27034":"Etienne Girardot is just a character actor--the sort of person people almost never would know by name.",
        "27036":"However, he once again plays the coroner--one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that played his role more than once.",
